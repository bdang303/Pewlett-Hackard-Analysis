# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
SQL Database

## Overview of the analysis
This analysis consisted of creating a SQL script that analyzes various data on employees from a hypothetical company. The company was expecting a large number of employees from the baby boomer generation to retire over the next several years. In order to help this company, prepare for the headcount required in certain roles, we need to determine how many employees were retiring as well as in which roles. Using multiple CSV files that contained employee data such as ID, name, date of birth, role, tenure, etc. we were able to provide valuable insights to help this company plan ahead.

## Results

-	Following the analysis, we identified over 72,000 employees who were retirement eligible
-	These employees spanned across 7 different roles

-	There were over 1,500 employees who are eligible to be mentors
-	6 out of the 7 roles in which there are employees retiring have an eligible mentor. “Manager” is the only role in which a mentor doesn’t exist.

## Summary

-How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? There are 72,458 employees who will need to be replaced across 7 different jobs.
-Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? With 1,549 retirement-ready mentors, that seems like a fairly low number of mentors
- 1,549 mentors only represents 2.1% of the total population of retire eligible employees
